Background
==========

A young girl lives in a modest but loving household with her two parents.

Her parents think of her as their world, and she loves both of her parents very
much.

Her parents are inventors, a skill which the girl always felt had not been
passed down the genetic line. Their inventing skills were used to supply the
town with creative solutions to minor problems: [insert fun examples here]. They
had not been particulary successful in breaking into a larger industry; their
ideals against intellectual property kept them out of the larger corporations.
Besides, they were perfectly content in their small town with their friends and
a seemingly interminable stream of minor problems for them to solve.

They do, however, have one major project that they collaborate with
inventors-of-similar-ideals on: the very first free brain augmentation platform.

Brain augmentation was not a new technology. The first feasible attempts at its
implementation had begun [x years before, reserved for rich, created an
unprecedented gap in social hierarchies, ...]

[Girl fights through ranks.]

Partway through her ascension through the HQ, the girl finds her father passed
out. She tries to awaken him, but he is unresponsive aside from a few groans and
incomprehensible mutterings. She begins to leave the room, when she hears her
name. She rushes back to her father, who is slowly opening his eyes, a slight
smile on his face.

The girls asks her father what happened, assuming that he'd been maliciously
knocked unconscious by an antagonistic Corporation employee. Her father, slowly
coming-to, begins to explain.
