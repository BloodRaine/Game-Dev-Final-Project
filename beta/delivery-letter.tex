Mark Baldwin,

\te has made significant progress on \aeon since our Alpha delivery. We have
continued our rapid development and are on schedule to achieve our ambitions
milestone schedule.

In the \releasename we have finished all of the regions of our game world,
completed all of the assets, created a number of unique cards, implemented
elemental status types, finished adding music, and implemented a game
economy/inventory system.

Overall, the three main categories of improvements are Game world, Music, and
Assets. The following list outlines the major changes made in each of the above
categories.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Game World}
        \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
            \item all forest rooms are complete
            \item concept art for other rooms is complete
            \item world keeps track of defeated enemies
            \item all assets created and ready for integration into the broader
                game world
            \item framework of game economy/inventory system implemented
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Music}
        \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
            \item revised the title music
            \item made music for in the city and desert for future use
            \item some sound effects for combat
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Assets} a variety of assets were created including, but not
        limited to:
        \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
            \item 13 additional cards and associated actions
            \item new dragon, wolf, brute, and hopper enemies
            \item desert assets
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The above list is not comprehensive. We have worked very hard to improve the
overall quality of \aeon in the \releasename and we look forward to continuing
our rapid development of our game.

Sincerely,

\tab Jacob Davis \\
