Mark Baldwin,

\te has made significant progress on \aeon since our Phase VI delivery. We have
continued our rapid development and are on schedule to achieve our ambitions
milestone schedule.

In the \releasename we have implemented many crucial gameplay mechanics, fleshed
out the game story and narrative, and improved the overall game functionality.
At a high level, the three major improvements are an expanded world, a completed
story, and sound. The following list outlines the major changes made in each of
the above categories.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Expanded World}
        \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
            \item internal plumbing for room transitions added
            \item running into the different monsters takes the player to
                different battles
            \item if the player wins a battle (by attacking the monster until
                their health goes down to 0), the monster is removed from the
                game
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Completed Story}
        \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
            \item the story (as detailed in the \texttt{<project
                root>/plot/story}
                directory) has been fleshed out
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Sounds} there are sound effects for the following:
        \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
            \item background music for the intro room
            \item background music for the forest room
            \item background music for combat
            \item walking in the forest
            \item attacking the monsters
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The above list is not comprehensive. We have worked very hard to improve the
overall quality of \aeon in the \releasename and we look forward to continuing
our rapid development of our game.

Sincerely,

\tab Jacob Davis \\
