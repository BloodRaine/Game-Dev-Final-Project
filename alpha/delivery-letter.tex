Mark Baldwin,

\te has made significant progress on \aeon since our Phase VI delivery. We have
continued our rapid development and are on schedule to achieve our ambitions
milestone schedule.

In the \releasename we have implemented many crucial gameplay mechanics, fleshed
out the game story and narrative, and improved the overall game functionality.
At a high level, the three major improvements are an expanded world, a completed
story, and additional battles. The following list outlines the major changes
made in each of the above categories.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Expanded World}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item you can go up to a new forest room from the main forest room
            \item you can go right to a new forest room from the main forest
                room
                %TODO check
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Completed Story}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item the story (as detailed in BLAH has been fleshed out) %TODO
                %check
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Additional Battles}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item running into the different monsters takes the player to
                different battles
            \item if the player wins the battle (by attacking the monster until
                their health goes down to 0), the monster is removed from the
                game
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The above list is not comprehensive. We have worked very hard to improve the
overall look and feel of \aeon in the \releasename and we look forward to
continuing our swift development of our game.

Sincerely,

\tab Jacob Davis \\
