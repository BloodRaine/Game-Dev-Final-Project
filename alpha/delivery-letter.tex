\hfill \today

Mark Baldwin,

\te has made significant progress on \aeon since our Phase VI delivery. We have
continued our rapid development and are on schedule to achieve our ambitions
milestone schedule.

In the \releasename we have implemented many crucial gameplay mechanics and
fleshed out much of the general game functionality. At a high level, the three
major changes are improved graphics, a menu system, and a turn-based card combat
system. The following list outlines the major changes made in each of the above
categories.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Graphics}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item new grass, ground, and tree sprites
            \item new creatures and reference sprites
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Menu System}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item accessed by pressing \texttt{ESC} from the forest
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Card Combat System}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item a HUD showing the health of the player and opponent
            \item deck animations and display
            \item attack animations for both the player and the opponent
            \item temporary "Attack" button for testing attack mechanics
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The above list is not comprehensive. We have worked very hard to improve the
overall look and feel of \aeon in the \releasename and we look forward to
continuing our swift development of our game.

Sincerely,

\tab Jacob Davis \\
