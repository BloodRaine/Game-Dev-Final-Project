Mark Baldwin,

We are Epsilon Games, a newly formed game development company. We were founded with the purpose of
developing the most engaging, immersive, and enjoyable games on the market. To let you get a feel
for what our company is all about, we would like to present you with three of our best game
concepts. We hope to make one of these games a reality very soon.

In the coming weeks we plan on selecting a game to work on, and developing a project schedule. We
believe any of these games would be feasible to create within our timeframe, and we are excited to
begin working on one of them.

Sincerely,

\tab Jacob Davis \\

\subsection*{Assassins Feed Four}

{\it Assassins Feed Four} is a side-scrolling beat 'em up game. In {\it AFF},
players choose among the ninja, sniper, and other assassins who need to feed
their families and do so by brawling their way through various worlds to collect
both food and money. Each world's theme is based on a unique economic system,
including capitalism, dictatorship, and communism. Fight your way through each
world while upgrading your character's skillset, all to feed your family of
four!
