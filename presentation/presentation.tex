% The pitch proposal, sometimes known as a concept document, is typically a
% short document or PowerPoint designed to communicate the game concept and sell
% it to the publisher or investors.  In the real world this may run from 10-20
% pages but for this project and the given short time frame, the team need not
% prepare a full blown proposal. However, it should include basic technical
% details as well like how the team will build the game (languages, libraries,
% game engines, etc.  and team responsibilities). The pitch should run 5-6
% minutes.
