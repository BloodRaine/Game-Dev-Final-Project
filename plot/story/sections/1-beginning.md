Intro

**Vivian and her best friend, Ildico, are walking home from school.**

*Enter in, mid-conversation*

Ildico: "Nah, I still have to start working on that assignment. Math
         isn't...really my thing. But whatever, I'll figure it out."
Vivian: "Ha, fair enough. I can help if you end up stuck."
Ildico: "Nice, I'd really appreciate it. I'll let you know."

*pause*

Ildico: "What do you plan on doing for the 'faceoff' assignment in AI at the end
         of the semester?"
Vivian: "Hm, I haven't thought much about it. I have some ideas, but I'm not
         quite sure what exactly the requirements are yet. Prof. Yallia hasn't
         talked about it in class yet, has she?"
Ildico: "No, she hasn't. The gist is that you have to design and write an
         AI that completes a specific task. Then your AI is tested against the
         baseline AI, which is a general-purpose AI named Bailey, to see how
         the two compare. I remember seeing some of the submissions in the
         previous class's expo, there were some pretty cool ideas."
Vivian: "Like what?"
Ildico: "Let's see...this girl Darya, her AI tried to raise a child through
         early-adulthood. Bailey was able to raise its child well enough to
         become a lawyer for the non-augmented population, and to even have
         occasional consultant jobs from the augmented population!"
Vivian: "Wow, that's impressive! And Darya's?"
Ildico: "I think her's was only able to get a manager's job in a tea shop in
         its hometown. It was, interesting, though, becaue eventually it started
         to get fed up with its position in life. It ended up trying to break
         into one of the simulation's augmented-population towns and stealing an
         brain-augmentation system."
Vivian: "Whoa, had anything like that happened before?"
Ildico: "Right? And good question, I'm not sure."
Vivian: "That's crazy, I didn't realize that the simulations had reached that
         level of realism."
Ildico: "Mhm, neither had I.
Vivian: "Do you think the Bailey's child was hired to prosecute for the
         theft?"

*both laugh*

*Vivian and Ildico have arrived at Vivian's house*

Vivian: "You want to come in and hang out for a bit? My parents have been
         working on their brain augmentation platform a lot lately, so they're
         usually busy until dinner time."
Ildico: "I can't, unfortunately. My cousins arrived in town earlier today, so I
         should probably go see them."
Vivian: "Are these the same cousins that managed to break your simulation room
         by passing some ridiculous commands?"
Ildico: "Yep, the very same."
Vivian: "Haha, have fun with that. And holo me if you have any questions about
         the math assignment!"
Ildico: "Will do, see ya tomorrow Vivian!"

*Vivian goes inside. She works on her homework for a few hours, hardly seeing
her parents in that time. Around 6 pm, her parents walk into the kitchen while
discussing the project.*

**Vivian is working at the dining room table, her parents walk in from their
in-home office**

Father: "...got it to build and pass the tests. We'll have Remy look at it
         once Saria finishes her refactor, and if he thinks it looks solid then
         we'll merge it with the main branch."
Mother: "Sounds good. Whew, that was a long call, even for us."
Father: "Well this is one of our biggest feature adds. I can hardly believe how
         far this has come, it was so daunting at the beginning."
Mother: "I know! It only seems possible at all when I think back to the
         development of larger and larger pieces it took to get here."
Father: *Exhales, turns toward Vivian* "Hey Vivian, how was school today?"
Vivian: "It was good, same as usual. Hey, would either of you have any ideas for
         an AI I can write for my project? It just has to complete a task with
         a measurable outcome."
Mother: "How difficult does the task have to be?"
Vivian: "Well, Ildico told me about this one girl who made an AI to raise a
         child until it was a young adult. I think it can vary quite a bit,
         though."
Father: "Do you have any ideas yourself?"
Vivian: "Sort of. It could be fun to make one that somehow teaches itself to
         create art, like paint or compose music."
Mother: "Sounds interesting. But wouldn't the results of that be subjective?"
Vivian: "I guess so. Maybe it could look at an existing painting and try to
         replicate it exactly? Like paint all of the layers and detail in, and
         see how similar the results turn out."
Father: "Now that sounds measurable. How long do you have to decide on this?"
Vivian: "It hasn't even been officially assigned yet, so I have some time."
Father: "Well, maybe sit on that idea for a bit and note down any others, and
         we can talk about it more once you have all of the details."
Vivian: "Sounds good, dad. How was your guys' day?"
Mother: "Oh, it was stressful but exciting! We're making great progress on the
         platform, it's starting to look like it could be useful to everyday
         people soon!"
Vivian: "Wow, that is cool!"
Father: "It is very exciting, and we can tell you more about it over dinner. How
         about some nice sedian liver?"

[Fade in]

**Late that night, Vivian wakes up to get a glass of water**

*As she walks downstairs, she notices an orange glow coming through the window
in the living room*

Vivian: "What's that glow?"

*Vivian walks to the window*

Vivian: "The server shed! It's on fire!"

*Vivian rushes upstairs to her parents' room*

*She reaches the door, knocks loudly while yelling*

Vivian: "Mom! Dad! There's a fire in the server shed!"

*Receiving no response, Vivian opens the door to an empty bedroom and a messy
bed*

*She rushes downstairs*

*Vivian runs back downstairs to her parents' office, but they are nowhere to be
found*

Vivian: "Mom, dad, where are you?!"

*Looking out the window again, Vivian sees the fire spreading from the server
shed toward her parents' shed housing their many inventions. The door to the
shed is open. She runs outside toward the shed*

*Vivian reaches the shed and enters. The shed is in disarray*

Vivian: "Are you guys in here? What happened here...wait, the fire is going to
destroy all of my parents' inventions!"

*Vivian quickly sifts through the inventions and grabs one*

Vivian: "This is a good one. I should go check for my parents in the house one
more time."

*Vivian exits the shed and looks toward the house*

Vivian: "Is that...oh no, the house is on fire too!"

*A man walks up behind Vivian. He startles her, and she jumps and turns around*

Vivian: "Ah!!"

Knotts: "Hey, Vivian, it's okay. It's me, Deputy Knotts."

*Knotts is an android, and the deputy of the town*

Griffith: "Knotts, come'ere! We've got a squirmer hear!"

Knotts: "Vivian, go over to my car, we'll be there in a second."

[TODO: Cut to sheriff's office. Need to motivate man telling them that he was
hired by EvilCorp to help kidnap parents and destroy their work. Maybe
something like "damn it all, I didn't know there was a kid involved...".]

[After the above TODO, Vivian goes on journey]
