Intro
=====

Vivian and her best friend, Ildico, are walking home from school.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

*Enter in, mid-conversation*

Ildico: "Nah, I still have to start working on that assignment. Math
         isn't...really my thing. But whatever, I'll figure it out."
Vivian: "Ha, fair enough. I can help if you end up stuck."
Ildico: "Nice, I'd really appreciate it. I'll let you know."

*pause*

Ildico: "What do you plan on doing for the 'faceoff' assignment in AI at the end
         of the semester?"
Vivian: "Hm, I haven't thought much about it. I have some ideas, but I'm not
         quite sure what exactly the requirements are yet. Prof. Yallia hasn't
         talked about it in class yet, has she?"
Ildico: "No, she hasn't. The gist is that you have to design and write an
         AI that completes a specific task. Then your AI is tested against the
         baseline AI, which is a general-purpose AI, to see how the two compare.
         I remember seeing some of the submissions in the previous class's expo,
         there were some pretty cool ideas."
Vivian: "Like what?"
Ildico: "Let's see...one girl's AI tried to raise a child through
         early-adulthood. The baseline AI was able to raise its child well
         enough to become a lawyer for the non-augmented population, and even
         had occasional consultant jobs from the augmented population!"
Vivian: "Wow, that's impressive! And the student's?"
Ildico: "I think her's was only able to get a manager's job in a tea shop in
         its hometown. It was, interesting, though, becaue eventually it started
         to get fed up with its position in life. It ended up trying to break
         into one of the simulation's augmented-population towns and stealing an
         brain-augmentation system."
Vivian: "Whoa, had anything like that happened before?"
Ildico: "Right? And good question, I'm not sure."
Vivian: "That's crazy, I didn't realize that the simulations had reached that
         level of realism."
Ildico: "Mhm, neither had I.
Vivian: "Do you think the baseline's child was hired to prosecute for the
         theft?"

*both laugh*

*Vivian and Ildico have arrived at Vivian's house*

Vivian: "You want to come in and hang out for a bit? My parents have been
         working a lot on their brain augmentation platform a lot lately, so
         they're usually busy until dinner time."
Ildico: "I can't, unfortunately. My cousins arrived in town earlier today, so I
         should probably go see them."
Vivian: "Are these the same cousins that managed to break your simulation room
         by passing some ridiculous commands?"
Ildico: "Yep, the very same."
Vivian: "Haha, have fun with that. And holo me if you have any questions about
         the math assignment!"
Ildico: "Will do, see ya tomorrow Vivian!"

*Vivian goes inside. She works on her homework for a few hours, hardly seeing
her parents in that time. Around 6 pm, her parents walk into the kitchen while
discussing the project.*

Father: "...got it to build and pass the tests. We'll have Remy look at it
         once Saria finishes her refactor, and if he thinks it looks solid then
         we'll merge it with the main branch."
Mother: "Sounds good. Whew, that was a long call, even for us."
Father: "Well this is one of our biggest feature adds. I can hardly believe how
         far this has come, it was so daunting at the beginning."
Mother: "I know! It only seems possible at all when I think back to the
         incremental steps it took to get here."
Father: *Exhales, turns toward Vivian* "Hey Vivian, how was school today?"
