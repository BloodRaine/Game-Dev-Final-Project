Intro
=====

Vivian and her best friend, Ildico, are walking home from school.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

*Enter in, mid-conversation*

Ildico: "Nah, I still have to start working on that assignment. Math
         isn't...really my thing. But whatever, I'll figure it out."
Vivian: "Ha, fair enough. I can help if you end up stuck."
Ildico: "Nice, I'd really appreciate it. I'll let you know."

*pause*

Ildico: "What do you plan on doing for the 'faceoff' assignment in AI at the end
         of the semester?"
Vivian: "Hm, I haven't thought much about it. I have some ideas, but I'm not
         quite sure what exactly the requirements are yet. Prof. Yallia hasn't
         talked about it in class yet, has she?"
Ildico: "No, she hasn't. I remember seeing some of the submissions in the
         previous class's expo, there were some pretty cool ideas."
Vivian: "Like what?"
Ildico: "Let's see...one girl's AI tried to raise a child through
         early-adulthood. The baseline AI was able to raise the child well
         enough to become a lawyer for the non-augmented population, and even
         had occasional consultant jobs from the augmented population!"
Vivian: "Wow, that's impressive! And the student?"
Ildico: "I think her's was only able to get a manager's job in a tea shop in
         its hometown. It was, interesting, though, becaue eventually it started
         to get fed up with its position in life. It ended up trying to break
         into one of the simulation's augmented-population towns and stealing an
         brain-augmentation system."
Vivian: "Whoa, had anything like that happened before? And the virtual offspring
         started out identical, right?"
Ildico: "I don't know, and yep."
Vivian: "That's crazy, I didn't realize that the simulations had reached that
         level of realism."
Ildico: "Mhm, neither had I.
Vivian: "Do you think the lawyer was hired to prosecute for the theft?"

*both laugh*
