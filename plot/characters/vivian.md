Vivian was born in the small town of \hometown. Her parents, \dad and \mom, are
inventors. Working with both hardware and software, they solve the town's oddly
plentiful problems with simple and clever solutions. Vivian has always felt that
her parents' ingenuity had not been passed on to her. While Vivian had always
performed exceptionally in school, she feels that she is more of a leader than a
follower and often has trouble thinking for herself. She often sees both sides
of an argument very well, and usually is comfortable with a middleground
solution; when she does have a significant change to her worldview, it's often
the result of learning a new idea from someone else and rarely coming up with
anything original herself.
