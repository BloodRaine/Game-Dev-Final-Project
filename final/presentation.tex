% As well as the deliveries required for the final delivery on May 3, your team
% will need to make a presentation on your project starting April 26. The order
% of the presentations will be chosen at random so you will need to be prepared
% to give the presentation on the 26th. Because of the time I've allocated, each
% presentation should be between 10-13 minutes.
%
% What am I looking for with the presentation?   Here is what you should
% address...
%
% - General introduction to the game.
% - Demo the game to the class.
% - A brief post-mortem on the game project (see the project description for
%   more on a post mortem).   Note, you will each individually be providing a
%   post-mortem with your May 3 delivery, but this post-mortem should reflect
%   your observations as a team on the project.   You can use this material as a
%   foundation for your individual reports, but the individual reports need to
%   be unique and reflect each individuals personal observations.

\begin{frame}{The Ugly}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Expected more of the class to focus on this project rather than
              individual side projects
