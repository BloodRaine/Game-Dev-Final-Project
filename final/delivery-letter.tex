Mark Baldwin,

Since the Beta Release, \te has made incremental improvements to prepare for our
final presentation of \aeon. We have continued our rapid development and have
achieved the majority of our goals.

In the \releasename we fleshed out a few locations in the game world which were
not up to our quality standards. This included adding a few more assets and
making numerous bugfixes.

The following list outlines the major changes made in each of the above
categories.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Improved Assets}
        \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
            \item town assets added
            \item improved character sprites
            \item dragon added
            \item a few extra improvements to the graphics
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Bugfixes}
        \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
            \item fixed the room transitions
            \item fixed the menu system
            \item fixed the health recovery logic
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The above list is not comprehensive and does not include the work we did to
prepare for the final demo and presentation. We have worked very hard to improve
the overall quality of \aeon in the \releasename and we are excited about our
finished project.

Sincerely,

\tab Jacob Davis \\
