Mark Baldwin,

We have made significant progress on \textit{{\AE}on Chronicles} since we last
spoke. We intend to continue at this quick pace in order to keep up with the
rapid milestone schedule we have set for ourselves.

Since the last delivery, we have completed a number of major items. At the most
basic level, we have completed overworld movement mechanics for our main
character. We have a framework for NPC interaction set up. Furthermore, hooks
to begin combat have been added. Lastly, we added a very basic start menu, which
can be extended easily.

This delivery consists of one main item, our new game code. This code only has
one room for now, but any more than that was not a part of this delivery. All of
the features (discussed above) are present in this one room.

Sincerely,

\tab Jacob Davis \\
\tab Caleb Jhones \\
\tab Robbie Merillat \\
\tab Jonathan Sumner Evans \\
\tab David Grisham \\
