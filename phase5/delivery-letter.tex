Mark Baldwin,

We have made significant progress on \textit{{\AE}on Chronicles} since we last
spoke. We intend to continue at this quick pace in order to keep up with the
rapid milestone schedule we have set for ourselves.

Since the last delivery, we have completed a number of major items. We
successfully gave our project proposal to the class, and it was very well
received. We have completed our project plan, which details the required
tasks and milestones we must complete. It also defines risk management
and integration \& testing strategies. Furthermore, we have started work on
our game design document. This includes making story and gameplay decisions.

This delivery consists of a few items. Our complete project plan is included
for your review. We also have included our project plan and milestone schedule.

Sincerely,

\tab Jacob Davis \\
\tab Caleb Jhones \\
\tab Robbie Merillat \\
\tab Jonathan Sumner Evans \\
\tab David Grisham \\
